# What is this ?

This is a little project I'm making while studying for the ISTQB.

I haven't found any good program to make flashcards so I'm going to create my own with a simple carousel and cards that flip when you click them.
However, to generate the flashcards you have to create a data.json whose items must have :

- A "Question" key for the flashcard's question.

- An "Answer" key for the flashcard's answer.
